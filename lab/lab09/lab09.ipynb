    "Below is a tool that simulates a retirement or savings account. Each year, a fixed amount is deposited into the account. This is represented by `deposits`. In addition, the account compounds interest from last year's balance, with constant interest rate `r`. **`r` is expressed as a proportion.** So if an account yields 10% interest, `r = 0.1`. `t` is how many years this account accrues interest. In this example, if `t` is 0, the balance in the account is just the deposit as no interest has been accrued. If `t` is 1, the balance in the account is the initial deposit with interest compounded, plus the next year's deposit."

Therefore, you would like to hedge your holdings by purchasing options. If you purchase 100 shares of Tesla, what kind of option would you need to purchase to hedge against extreme losses in the event that Tesla's price drops? Please pick one of the four following options: `'long call'`, `'long put'`, `'short call'`, `'short put'`, making sure that your answer is a string that exactly matches one of the options.\n",
